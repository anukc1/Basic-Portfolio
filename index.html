        <p>I am an aspiring developer with background in biology and ultrasound. I graduated from the University of Maryland in 2012 with a biology degree. After graduation, I enrolled into ultrasound program and got certified as an ultrasound tech. I'v been a sonographer for almost 6 years.</p>

        <p>I love learning new things. So far coding has been challenging but I am loving it everytime i figure something out. Enjoying the ride.</p>

        <p>I love taking long walks, gardening, kayaking, watching movies on my off time. I have a beautiful little daughter that I love to bits and I cant wait to start this new episode of my life as a developer.</p>
